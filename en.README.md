# Projects
## the DeveloperWeek AI/ML 2024 Hackathon in San Francisco - [Linkedin update](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7212767328386568192/)
- Together we built an personalized AI assistant that helps everyone organize YouTube shorts, reels and tiktoks, etc. The problem we tackled is all too familiar: we watch & save countless videos, but rarely revisit them due to the difficulty of finding and remembering what we've saved. Our solution uses cutting-edge tech to change that. Our agent, built on a robust tech stack featuring AWS Bedrock, Knowledge Bases for Bedrock, LaunchDarkly, NextJS, and Flask, learns users' preferences and categorizes their saved videos into personalized collection
